      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">My name is Shemar, and I’m a developer. My goal in life is to become a full stack developer. <br>I have a natural interest in technology and all facets surrounding it.<br> This website was created as a way to practice
        my craft and serve as a basis as an introduction into my capabilities.</p>

        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p class="c-par">Whether it be coding for the "Hello World" output or figuring out how to create a scorecard using <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-oriented-programming-oops-concept-in-java/">Object-orientated</a> paradigms,
          i've always tried to deliver my solution the best way I knew possible. For years i've been fascinated with how actual programs work and after  years of studying the craft im even more interested in what i can actual create using what i've learned.</p>

        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p class="d-par">Typically when one thinks above design the thought of colour and fancy layouts comes to mind. For me being a youtube was always fascinating. This led me to hours upon hours trying to figure
        out how to photoshop, blendgraphics together, or finding ways to transition from one scene to the next seamlessly. For me design expresses the idea I have and when i mix it with the solution i developed it brings a level of self satisfaction
      that words don't seem to do justice. </p>
